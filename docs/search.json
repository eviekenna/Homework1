It is about tidying, transforming, visualizing, modeling and communicating the data in a way that is valuable to a problem that needs solving.\nThere are many similarities between statisticians and data scientist the main being that they both work heavily with data. There are also a lot of differences which include:\n\nstatisticians mainly focus on science while data scientists mainly focus on the problem and results.\nstatisticians use mostly clean, small and organized data while data science often uses the opposite.\nstatisticians bring the data to the model while data scientists bring the model to the data.\n\nIn relation to these two areas I view myself as more of a data scientist.
